Tools for translating transistor netlists to HDL in a style that
supports switch-level emulation.

To run the apple1basic demo, install verilator and then do a "make
demo".  The verilator translation and C++ compile will take several
minutes, and the apple1basic code, the statement "PRINT 1234/7", will
take an additional several minutes before the response is given on the
console.

See verilator/sim_main.cpp for the simulation code.  The 6502 model
itself is in verilog/chip_6502.v.
